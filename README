Have you ever wanted to run your own 'numbers station' [0] but you
just don't have anything to say? Then, babble is the program for you!

babble will generate nonsensical 'sentences', convert the characters
into Morse Code, and play the audio of the Morse Code dots and
dashes. You can send that audio data to a transmitter, and before you
know it, you will have your very own numbers station.
